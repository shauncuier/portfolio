## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shauncuier/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the project in your default web browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized production build.
